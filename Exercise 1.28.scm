; Exercise 1.28: One variant of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled is called the Miller-Rabin test (Miller 1976; Rabin 1980). This starts from an alternate form of Fermat’s Little Theorem, which states that if nn is a prime number and aa is any positive integer less than nn, then aa raised to the (n−1)(n−1)-st power is congruent to 1 modulo nn. To test the primality of a number nn by the Miller-Rabin test, we pick a random number a<na<n and raise aa to the (n−1)(n−1)-st power modulo nn using the expmod procedure. However, whenever we perform the squaring step in expmod, we check to see if we have discovered a “nontrivial square root of 1 modulo nn,” that is, a number not equal to 1 or n−1n−1 whose square is equal to 1 modulo nn. It is possible to prove that if such a nontrivial square root of 1 exists, then nn is not prime. It is also possible to prove that if nn is an odd number that is not prime, then, for at least half the numbers a<na<n, computing an−1an−1 in this way will reveal a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo nn. (This is why the Miller-Rabin test cannot be fooled.) Modify the expmod procedure to signal if it discovers a nontrivial square root of 1, and use this to implement the Miller-Rabin test with a procedure analogous to fermat-test. Check your procedure by testing various known primes and non-primes. Hint: One convenient way to make expmod signal is to have it return 0.

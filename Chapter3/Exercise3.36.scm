; Exercise 3.36: Suppose we evaluate the following sequence of expressions in the global environment:

; (define a (make-connector))
; (define b (make-connector))
; (set-value! a 10 'user)
; At some time during evaluation of the set-value!, the following expression from the connectorâ€™s local procedure is evaluated:

; (for-each-except 
;   setter inform-about-value constraints)
; Draw an environment diagram showing the environment in which the above expression is evaluated.

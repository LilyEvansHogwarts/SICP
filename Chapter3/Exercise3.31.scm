; Exercise 3.31: The internal procedure accept-action-procedure! defined in make-wire specifies that when a new action procedure is added to a wire, the procedure is immediately run. Explain why this initialization is necessary. In particular, trace through the half-adder example in the paragraphs above and say how the systemâ€™s response would differ if we had defined accept-action-procedure! as

(define (accept-action-procedure! proc)
  (set! action-procedures 
        (cons proc action-procedures)))

(define (make-wire)
  (let ((signal-value 0) 
        (action-procedures '()))
    (define (set-my-signal! new-value)
      (if (not (= signal-value new-value))
          (begin (set! signal-value new-value)
                 (call-each 
                  action-procedures))
          'done))
    (define (accept-action-procedure! proc)
      (set! action-procedures 
            (cons proc action-procedures))
      (proc))
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'get-signal) 
             signal-value)
            ((eq? m 'set-signal!) 
             set-my-signal!)
            ((eq? m 'add-action!) 
             accept-action-procedure!)
            (else (error "Unknown operation: 
                          WIRE" m))))
    dispatch))


;if not being run immediately, then the change effect to a wire won't appear until that particular wire being set to a new signal

Exercise 5.20: Draw the box-and-pointer representation and the memory-vector representation (as in Figure 5.14) of the list structure produced by

(define x (cons 1 2))
(define y (list x x))
with the free pointer initially p1. What is the final value of free? What pointers represent the values of x and y?

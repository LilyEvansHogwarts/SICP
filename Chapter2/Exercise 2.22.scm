; Exercise 2.22: Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first square-list procedure of Exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process:

; (define (square-list items)
;   (define (iter things answer)
;     (if (null? things)
;         answer
;         (iter (cdr things)
;               (cons (square (car things))
;                     answer))))
;   (iter items nil))
; Unfortunately, defining square-list this way produces the answer list in the reverse order of the one desired. Why?

recursive is down up while  iter is down-up, the upest in the downest 

; Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the arguments to cons:

; (define (square-list items)
;   (define (iter things answer)
;     (if (null? things)
;         answer
;         (iter (cdr things)
;               (cons answer
;                     (square 
;                      (car things))))))
;   (iter items nil))
; This doesnâ€™t work either. Explain.
only make (cdr x) be the element of x, so it went wrong

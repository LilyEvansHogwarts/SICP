; Exercise 2.16: Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different answers. Can you devise an interval-arithmetic package that does not have this shortcoming, or is this task impossible? (Warning: This problem is very difficult.)

because of the different arithmetic result between of interval and integerã€‚
impossible, because A/A wouldn't be one if A and A is not the same , it would be one if they are the same, and the element in the equivalent algebraic expressions have to be irrelevent in interval-arithmetic while not.
with +- inner in the actual cause of (x +- ux)(y +- uy), choice of +- depend on the minus and plus while ab+ac = a(b + c) you get different +- in the unfolding expressions in math in two sides of the equation which makes it unqual

; After considerable work, Alyssa P. Hacker delivers her finished system. Several years later, after she has forgotten all about it, she gets a frenzied call from an irate user, Lem E. Tweakit. It seems that Lem has noticed that the formula for parallel resistors can be written in two algebraically equivalent ways:
; R1R2R1+R2
; R1R2R1+R2
; and
; 11/R1+1/R2.
; 11/R1+1/R2.
; He has written the following two programs, each of which computes the parallel-resistors formula differently:

; (define (par1 r1 r2)
;   (div-interval 
;    (mul-interval r1 r2)
;    (add-interval r1 r2)))

; (define (par2 r1 r2)
;   (let ((one (make-interval 1 1)))
;     (div-interval 
;      one
;      (add-interval 
;       (div-interval one r1) 
;       (div-interval one r2)))))
; Lem complains that Alyssaâ€™s program gives different answers for the two ways of computing. This is a serious complaint.

; Exercise 2.14: Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the behavior of the system on a variety of arithmetic expressions. Make some intervals AA and BB, and use them in computing the expressions A/AA/A and A/BA/B. You will get the most insight by using intervals whose width is a small percentage of the center value. Examine the results of the computation in center-percent form (see Exercise 2.12).

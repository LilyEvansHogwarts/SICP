; Exercise 2.76: As a large system with generic operations evolves, new types of data objects or new operations may be needed. For each of the three strategies—generic operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and message-passing-style—describe the changes that must be made to a system in order to add new types or new operations. Which organization would be most appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added? Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?

changs making that you could just change in one place make it the most convenience to do, and base on this principle, here the answer
1 new type added the most often which carried with a set of operations, that for data directed style and message-passing, by just adding a new type packages or just type as procedure
2 as for operations, the explicit dispatch is the best.

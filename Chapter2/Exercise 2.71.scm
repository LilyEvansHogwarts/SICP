; Exercise 2.71: Suppose we have a Huffman tree for an alphabet of nn symbols, and that the relative frequencies of the symbols are 1,2,4,…,2n−11,2,4,…,2n−1. Sketch the tree for n=5n=5; for n=10n=10. In such a tree (for general nn) how many bits are required to encode the most frequent symbol? The least frequent symbol?
; 1 for the most
; n-1 for the least
